# KinShip-Verification-using-CNNs

Team : Harsha Vardhan Pokkalla & Divya Ravichandran

ConvNets have shown the best performance in image classification and detection in recent years. In this project, we are exploring ConvNets to extract the hidden and more
complex information in the images. We define our task: Given a pair of images, a trained model has to verify the relationship between two persons using their facial information. Here, as an initial step, we are considering faces - we try to predict the existence of a Kinship
Relationship [Mother -Son, Mother- Daughter, Father - Son, Father- Daughter] between a pair of faces. Also, we extend this theory to a new dataset that we build to test the
idea, containing faces of couples who are together in real life. We implemented Siamese networks to do this task. We achieved better performance scores with ConvNets
compared to shallow learning techniques
